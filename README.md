## Algorithm

By shaving off the extra pixels from the square and bringing them together in the center, the 2D sprite is made to look like 3D.

The planets' patterns are generated by some simple noise functions.  
If the plane references 2D noise, it will be scaled incorrectly, like Mercator projection. Therefore, the 3D noise is compressed into a 2D plane.  
In other words, it converts 3D noise into a 2D plane and makes it look like a 3D sphere.
